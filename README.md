This is a to-do list app with full CRUD functionality. Users can add tasks, mark tasks as done and delete tasks.

## Scope

- The user has the ability to view the tasks they've saved to the database
- The user has the ability to mark tasks as done

## User research

### Purpose of research

The purpose of the research was to understand why users use to-do list apps and what they want to achieve while using these types of app and to understand what kind of tasks users carry out on these types of apps.

### User research methods

For the qualitative research, I interviewed people who had experience with managing tasks online and for the quantitative research, I carried out a survey to find out about what users expect from a to-do list app.

### Key insights from the user research

- Users want to be able to add tasks to their to-do list app
- Users want the ability to view the tasks they've saved in their to-do list app
- Users want the ability to mark tasks as done on their to-do list app
